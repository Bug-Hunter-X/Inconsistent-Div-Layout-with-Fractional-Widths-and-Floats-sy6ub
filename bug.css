The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code intends to make the div elements occupy 50% of the container's width each and align side-by-side. However, if the container's width is not an even multiple of the div's width (50%), the divs might overlap or not display correctly.  The issue stems from the imprecise nature of floating elements and how browsers handle fractional widths.
